          <h2>Pickpocketing</h2>
          <p>
            According to the NYPD, pickpocketing incidents increase during the
            months of August, September and October, obviously during the start
            of the school year. In the majority of the reported incidents, the
            victim had their wallet removed from their backpack front
            compartment, a common location where students put their wallets.
            Carry your bag in front of you. Gentlemen, carry your wallet in your
            front pocket. Common locations where thieves target victims: By the
            subway turnstiles – Thief one walks in front of you swiping their
            metro card but they use a card that denies them access while the
            second thief is behind you, bumps into you removing your property
            (cell phone, wallet, etc) In a crowded train – removing your wallet
            from your backpack front compartment. Going up or down the stairs of
            the subway – removing your property from your backpack front
            compartment. Pickpockets thieves look like you and I and usually
            work in a team of two or three. To view an excellent news
            project/short video created by a Columbia Journalism student, visit
            Pickpocketing in the subways. Please share with students, faculty,

          <h2>Four Ways to Increase Your Personal Safety</h2>
          <p>
            Reduce or eliminate opportunities that may make you a target.
            Increase awareness in places where you're most comfortable. Trust
            your instincts even if you feel embarrassed. Prepare your schedule
            daily with safety in mind. Be AWARE of your surroundings at all
            times and trust your INSTINCTS. Stay in well lit, populated
            pathways. Avoid shortcuts. Travel in groups. There's always safety
            in numbers. Walk with your head upright. Make eye contact. Thieves
            often target victims who are not paying attention to their
            surroundings or who are looking down. Pay attention to your
            surroundings when using electronics on the streets, subways & buses.
            Don't TUNE yourself out. DON'T WALK AND TEXT. Don't display
            electronics when not in use. Avoid becoming a victim of "Apple
            Picking." View this short P.S.A. from the NYPD. Change the color of
            your earphones from "White" to any other color. White earphones
            usually indicates that you have an APPLE DEVICE which is an
            attractive target for thieves. Avoid traveling through parks after
            dark. Before entering your apartment building, have your keys ready.

          <p>
            Police departments nationwide are reporting an increase in snatching
            of electronic devices from individuals who carry their smart phone
            in their hands NOT paying attention to their surroundings, listening
            to music or even texting while walking. Police Recommend: Keep your

          <h2>Prevent Theft of Unattended Packages at Your Building</h2>
          <p>
            There are steps you can take to help prevent theft of unattended
            packages from happening to you or your neighbors. Pick up packages
            as quickly as possible. Leaving packages in the lobby for an
            extended period of time increases the chances of theft. Most major
            shipping companies offer online package tracking, and some can even
            send you a notification when your package arrives. Utilize these and
            other services to avoid leaving your delivery unattended for long
            periods of time. Don't allow building access blindly. Verify a
            visitor’s identity over the intercom before letting them in. Keep an
            eye out for suspicious activity like loitering and "piggybacking."
            People may wait outside the building for someone to leave or enter,
            allowing them access to an open door. If you believe someone has
            entered the building on false pretenses, call Public Safety
            immediately. Request a signature or schedule a delivery. Many
            shipping companies allow you to request a specific time frame for
            delivery, such as an evening or weekend when you know you will be
            home. You can also request that the package not be left without a
            signature. That way, if you are not around to sign, the carrier will
            try delivering your package at a later date. Use a locker or other
            secure location. Sign up for free services such as FedEx Delivery
            Manager® and UPS My Choice® or use Amazon Lockers to deliver your
            package to a local retail store or another secure location until you
            are able to pick it up. The FedEx Office Ship Center on 116th and
            Broadway and the UPS Store on 115th and Broadway will also hold
            packages for pickup upon request. Visit their websites to learn
            more. Ship your items where you have the best chance of receiving
            them, such as your office or place of work. Family members, trusted
            neighbors, or friends may be home when you are not. Consider asking
            them to accept packages on your behalf or hold them until you
            arrive.

          <h2>Identity Theft a Growing Epidemic</h2>
          <p>
            Identity theft occurs when someone wrongfully uses your personal
            identification to obtain credit, loans, services, even rentals and
            mortgages in your name. Information can be stolen from a consumer in
            a variety of ways including: Going through your mail or trash to
            take pre-approved credit card offers, discarded receipts or other
            personal information; stealing your purse or wallet; calling you
            over the phone posing as a solicitor in order to gain personal
            information including date of birth and social security number or
            looking over your shoulder at an ATM while you are accessing your
            account, to steal your password, or pin. Avoid becoming a victim:
            Order copies of your credit report from all 3 credit reporting
            agencies to get as much information as possible. Contact the credit
            reporting agencies in writing and let them know you are disputing
            inaccurate items in your credit report due to possible identity
            theft. Contact the credit card companies who are reporting the false
            debt and have them investigate possible identity theft. Keep all
            copies of all letters; document phone calls and request a letter
            from the agencies stating these items are under investigation. Do
            not carry important documents such as your social security card,
            birth certificate or passport unless absolutely necessary. Only
            carry the credit cards in your purse or wallet that you need when
            shopping. Keep a list of your credit card account numbers, with
            expiration dates and telephone numbers for all your bank accounts
            and keep them in a safe location. In an emergency, you can notify
            these companies quickly to avoid fraudulent charges or purchases.
            Invest in a shredder and shred discarded papers with your
            information. Use a mix of letters and numbers when creating
            passwords.

          <h2>Using Electronics - MP3 Player & Cell Phones</h2>
          <p>
            According to the New York City Police Department, the snatching of
            electronic devices is on the rise across the city and in many other
            large cities around the world. This is due to both the increased
            value and ubiquity of these devices. A common element in these
            incidents is that the victims are not paying attention to their
            surroundings, distracted by the device in question. Quite often the
            perpetrator follows the victim from behind and snatches the
            electronic device right out of his or her hand. In a number of these
            incidents, the perpetrators were riding bicycles when they targeted
            their victim. These events are not limited to the streets and have
            also occurred on subways and buses. The NYPD & FBI are currently
            investigating fencing operations (stores) that are buying these
            stolen electronic devices. To avoid being a victim: Pay attention to
            your surroundings, minimize the amount of time you talk on your cell
            phone in public places. If you suspect you are being followed, go
            into an open store or a Public Safety Safe Haven and have the clerk
            call the Police or Public Safety right-away. Keep all electronic
            devices in an inside jacket pocket. Avoid clipping them onto outer
            garments or displaying them anywhere visible. If your cell phone is
            stolen, call your carrier and report the theft. Request that an
            alert be placed on the phone, preventing its use.

            Plan your route, know where you are going before leaving. Try to
            walk places with your friends rather than alone. Stick to
            well-lighted, well-traveled streets. Avoid shortcuts through wooded
            areas, parking lots, or alleys. Take the safest route to and from
            schools, stores, or your friends' houses. Know where to go for help
            if you need it. Don't display your cash or any other inviting
            targets like pagers, cell phones, hand-held electronic games, or
            expensive jewelry and clothing. Carry your backpack or purse close
            to your body and keep it closed. Just carrying a wallet? Put it
            inside your coat or front pants pocket, not in your back pocket or
            in your backpack. Have your car or house key in your hand before you
            reach the door. If you think someone is following you, change
            direction or cross the street. If they're still there, move quickly
            toward an open store or restaurant or a lighted house. Don't be
            afraid to yell for help. Have to work or study late? Call for a
            Public Safety Escort to walk you to your car, the nearest
            transportation (Train, bus or the Public Safety Shuttle bus. Be
            alert in the neighborhood. Call the police 911 to report suspicious

          your car keys with you, even if you just have to run inside for one
          minute. Roll up the windows and lock car doors, even if you're coming
          right back. Check inside and out before getting in. Avoid parking in
          isolated areas. If you are uncomfortable, ask a security guard or
          store staff to watch you or escort you to your car. Drive to the
          nearest gas station, open business, or other well-lighted, crowded
          area to get help if you think you are being followed. Don't head home.
          Use your cellular phone, if you have one, to call the police if you
          are being followed or you've seen an accident. Otherwise, stay off

          <p>
            Plan your trip before leaving.Always look as if you know where
            you're going, and you're better off not displaying money in public.
            Always carry your wallet in your front pocket and carry your bag
            (pocket book, book bag) in front of you to avoid being a victim of a
            pickpocket. Do not display electronics or jewelry. Avoid standing at
            the end of subway platforms or on an empty platform. Instead, wait
            in the Off-Hours Waiting Area, particularly at night. Most stations
            have one, generally located on the mezzanine level, near a station
            booth. Speak to the station agent or other NYC Transit employees
            (who wear bright orange vests) if you have a problem. Use a Customer
            Assistance Intercom (mounted on a platform column) to get help in a
            station where you're not visible to the station agent. When you
            speak into the Customer Assistance Intercom, the agent can speak
            with you. You can also use a public phone on the mezzanine or
            platform to dial 911 (the police) if you need help. This call is
            free. Each station booth posts the district and phone number of the
            NYPD unit that patrols the station. When it's not an emergency, use
            this number to contact the police. Electronic signs in many
            Off-Hours Waiting Areas indicate when a train is approaching the
            station. If you wait near the sign, you will have enough time to
            walk to the platform as the train arrives. During late hours it
            recommended to stay in the first or middle subway car where the
            conductor or the motor person has a radio to alert the police if
            necessary. Use well-lighted, busy stops. If you must get off at a
            little-used stop, try to arrange for a friend or an adult to meet
            you. Stay alert! Don't doze or daydream. Say, "leave me alone"
            loudly if someone hassles you. Don't be embarrassed. Watch who gets
            off your stop with you. If you feel uneasy, walk directly to a place
            where there are other people. Bus customers who travel between 10
            p.m. and 5 a.m. can Request-a-Stop. Ask the bus operator to let you
            off anywhere along the route, even if it isn't a designated stop.
            The bus operator will comply as long as he or she thinks it's a safe
            location. This bus will still make all regularly scheduled stops.

          <h2>Home Safety</h2>
          <p>
            Have your keys ready before you get to the door. Look back before
            entering your building or home. If you live in an apartment, close
            the lobby door behind you, especially if a stranger is approaching.
            Do not hold the door open for strangers. Make all visitors and
            delivery persons use the doorbell. When placing your name on
            mailboxes or on your bell, use only the last name, e.g., The Smiths.
            When recording an outgoing message on your answering machine, avoid
            leaving your name, phone number or a message that indicates you're
            not at home. A good message is, "We are unable to answer the phone.
            Please leave a message." Say it confidently.

          <h2>Chemical Security Awareness</h2>
          <p>
            Many chemicals and other hazardous materials used in research and
            other scholarly activities at a university are also potential
            targets of theft and criminal activity. The security and safety of
            chemicals and hazardous materials is the shared responsibility of
            all users. The brochure linked below -- prepared by Environmental
            Health & Safety -- contains information on awareness, vigilance and
            preparedness to aid in the safeguarding of these materials.
            Remember: See Something, Say Something.
